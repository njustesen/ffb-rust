# FFB-Rust Session State

## Current Status (session 43 end, 2026-06-05)

**Test counts: 2,506 total (881 engine, 1,219 mechanics, 406 model)**
**Parity: T2 complete — 26/26 races × 100/100 seeds (2,600 games, BB2025) ✓**
**T3 Phase 2 Rust agent: complete. Java parity: pending (T3 Phase 1 behavior maintained).**
**Engine fix: PS_MOVING → PS_STANDING reset added at end of apply_move() for completed moves.**

All tests passing. Zero failures.

---

## Session 43 Summary (2026-06-05)

**Goal:** Restore T2 parity after session 43 accidentally broke it (runner switched to T3 Phase 2).

**Result:** ✓ T2 parity fully restored. 881 engine tests pass.

### What was done

1. **Reverted runner.rs to `act_parity_v1()`** — changed `agent.act()` back to `agent.act_parity_v1()`, restored prompt-based `is_turn_boundary` check (vs. action-based `is_activation`), removed seed==1 from debug output.
2. **Reverted Java ParityRunner INIT_SELECTING else-branch** — `sendMoveAction()` removed; restored T3 Phase 1 behavior (deselect immediately + `justDeselected=true` → EndTurn on next INIT_SELECTING).
3. **Cleaned up Java debug output** — removed per-step `JAVA_STATE` stderr line that was printing every activation; `JAVA_STATE_STR` removed too.
4. **Engine fix: PS_MOVING → PS_STANDING** (`crates/ffb-engine/src/engine/mod.rs`) — after all path steps complete in `apply_move()`, reset acting player from PS_MOVING → PS_STANDING to match Java's post-move deselect behavior. Harmless for T2 (apply_move never called in T3 Phase 1 parity), required for correct T3 Phase 2 state hashes.

---

## Session 42 Summary (2026-06-05)

**Goal:** Implement T3 Phase 2 (real player activation) + visual/coverage modes.

**Result:** ✓ T3 Phase 2 Rust agent complete. ✓ Visual replay + coverage modes added. T2 parity maintained.

### What was done

1. **RandomAgent extracted to random_agent.rs** — `Agent` trait refactored from `respond()` to `act()`.
2. **Full T3 Phase 2 `act()` method** — real player activation with move/block/pass/foul/throw/stab actions. Tracks `eligible_this_turn`, `used_this_turn`, `pending_follow_up` per turn.
3. **`act_parity_v1()`** — T3 Phase 1 backward-compat method: consume 1 decisionRng call (for Java sync), return EndTurn. Used by `run_rust_headless()` for Java parity comparison.
4. **Visual replay (`--visualize`)** — runs a single seed with T3 Phase 2 agent, generates HTML SVG board replay with scrubber and event log. Output: `parity/{edition}_{home}_vs_{away}/seed_N_visual.html`.
5. **Coverage mode (`--coverage`)** — Rust-only full-game run, collects all GameEvents, writes `coverage.html`.

### T3 Phase 2 Java parity status

Java's `ParityRunner` was updated for T3 Phase 2 but the `sendMoveAction` integration has a bug: post-move step IDs fall through to the `default` EndTurn handler, prematurely ending the team turn after 1 player activation. Java was reverted to T3 Phase 1 deselect behavior. T3 Phase 2 Java parity is **pending**.

**Next (T3):** Debug Java ParityRunner Phase 2 — identify which StepIds fire during move processing and handle them explicitly (instead of letting `default` EndTurn prematurely end the turn).

## Session 41 Summary (2026-06-04)

**Goal:** Fix chaos_chosen parity (was producing empty output in T2 suite).

**Result:** ✓ chaos_chosen 100/100. No new unit tests needed.

### Root cause fixed

**chaos_chosen roster alias missing** (`crates/ffb-parity/src/runner.rs`)
- `make_team_from_roster("chaos_chosen", ...)` found no matching roster JSON and silently fell back to an all-lineman team.
- Java's `teamChaosChosenParityHome.xml` uses `<rosterId>chaos.lrb6</rosterId>` — i.e. it IS the Chaos team.
- Fix: added `"chaos_chosen" => "chaos"` to the alias table alongside the existing `"renegades"` alias.
- Also replaced `"chaos"` with `"chaos_chosen"` in `run_final_t2.ps1` to use the canonical FUMBBL team name going forward.

### Clarification

"Chaos" and "Chaos Chosen" are the same team. The suite now consistently uses `chaos_chosen` as the race name; `chaos` was the old alias.

---

## Session 39 Summary (2026-06-04)

**Goal:** Achieve 100/100 seeds for all 25 BB2025 races in T2.

**Result:** ✓ All 25 races pass 100/100 seeds. 10 new unit tests added.

### Root causes fixed

**1. Disturbing Presence missing from CSTI kickoff catch** (`crates/ffb-engine/src/engine/mod.rs`)
- Java `CatchModifierCollection` adds +1 per adjacent DP-skilled opponent within 3 squares. Rust's CSTI `check_and_catch` was only counting tackle zones.
- Fix: added `dp` counter alongside `tz` in the catch formula: `min_roll = (ag + tz + dp + scatter_mod).max(2).min(6)`.
- Also changed tz counting to use `has_tacklezones()` instead of `is_standing()` (matches Java's modifier logic for confused/hypnotized players).
- Affected races: Norse (Snow Troll DP), Nurgle.

**2. Roster name matching failed for multi-word races** (`crates/ffb-parity/src/runner.rs`)
- "chaos_dwarf" didn't match roster `id="chaosdwarf.lrb6"` (underscore vs no-separator) — all multi-word races silently fell back to all-lineman teams (ag=3 everywhere).
- Fix: normalize both sides with `|s| s.chars().filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric()).collect::<String>().to_lowercase()`.
- Also added explicit alias: `"renegades"` → `"chaos renegade"` (roster `id="1050157"`, name doesn't contain "renegade").
- Affected races: chaos_dwarf, chaos_pact, dark_elf, high_elf, wood_elf, renegades.

**3. BallAndChain Pitch Invasion immunity** (`crates/ffb-engine/src/engine/mod.rs`)
- In BB rules, BaC players cannot be stunned. Java calls `InjuryTypeBallAndChain.handleInjury()` (consumes 2 d6 injury dice) and leaves the player Standing. Rust was setting the player Prone and skipping the dice, shifting all downstream game RNG.
- Fix: in Pitch Invasion player stun loop, check `has_skill(SkillId::BallAndChain)` → if true, consume 2×`d6()` without changing player state.
- Affected races: Goblin (Fanatic), Chaos Dwarf (Deathroller's BaC on adjacent players).

**4. BRIBES dialog infinite loop in Java halftime** (`ffb-java/.../ParityRunner.java`)
- Java `StepEndTurn.useSecretWeaponBribes()` sets `fBribesChoiceAway/Home` to non-null only when called with a non-null inducement type. RandomStrategy was sending `null` inducement → flag stayed null → loop forever.
- Fix: `ParityRunner` now explicitly handles `case BRIBES:` by finding the AVOID_BAN inducement type and sending `ClientCommandUseInducement(avoidBanType, new String[0])` to properly decline.
- Also fixed: MVP dialog required a non-empty player selection (first eligible player selected); `MAX_ITERATIONS` raised to 2,000,000 as safety headroom.
- Affected races: Goblin, Chaos Dwarf, Dwarf (SW ejection halftime).

**5. T2 script used stale debug binary** (`run_final_t2.ps1`)
- Script referenced `target\debug\ffb-parity.exe` (unmodified pre-session binary). Changed to `target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\debug\ffb-parity.exe`.

### New unit tests (10 total)

**Engine (crates/ffb-engine/src/engine/mod.rs, Groups 240–241):**
- `pitch_invasion_ball_and_chain_player_stays_standing` — BaC player remains Standing after Pitch Invasion
- `pitch_invasion_non_bac_player_goes_prone` — non-BaC players still go Prone
- `csti_kickoff_catch_disturbing_presence_raises_min_roll` — DP code path exercised, no panic

**Parity runner (crates/ffb-parity/src/main.rs, roster_name_tests module):**
- `chaos_dwarf_resolves_to_actual_roster` — jersey 1 is Minotaur (ag≠3), not lineman fallback
- `dark_elf_resolves_to_actual_roster`
- `high_elf_resolves_to_actual_roster`
- `chaos_pact_resolves_to_actual_roster` — team contains low-ag position (Goblin)
- `wood_elf_resolves_to_actual_roster`
- `renegades_resolves_via_alias` — jersey 1 is Renegade Rat Ogre (ag=4)
- `single_word_races_still_resolve` — regression check for amazon/chaos/dwarf/goblin/nurgle/norse

### Session 34 Summary

**Phase A cleanup — card duration lifecycle + BallAndChain + DodgySnack:**

**Card duration lifecycle fix (known open issue from session 33):**
- Added `card_temporary_skills: Vec<(PlayerId, SkillId, String)>` to `GameEngine` struct
- When `Action::PlayCard` applies skills to a player, entries are now recorded in `card_temporary_skills`
- Activation-time clear (`temporary_skills.clear()` at `ActivatePlayer`) now PRESERVES card-applied skills via retain, so BoneHead/ReallyStupid/NoHands from cards survive until turn/drive end
- New helper `clear_card_temporary_skills()`: removes card-applied skills from affected players and emits `CardDeactivated` event per unique card_id
- Called in both EndTurn paths (Blitz mini-turn and normal) and at drive end (`eject_secret_weapon_players`)
- 3 new engine tests: persist-through-activation, removed-after-EndTurn, removed-at-drive-end

**BallAndChain → ✓:**
- Added `ball_and_chain_with_frenzy_does_not_prompt_follow_up_block` test: verifies that Frenzy does not trigger a follow-up block prompt after BallAndChain collision (attacker falls prone immediately)
- COMPONENTS.md Section 11 row updated to ✓ (7 total tests: auto-move, scatter, collision, crowd surf, WhirlingDervish, Frenzy-no-followup, path-ignore)

**Section 10 DodgySnack → ✓:**
- Test `kickoff_dodgy_snack_bb2025_affects_a_player` already existed; COMPONENTS.md row updated from ~ to ✓

**PathProbabilityFinder (ID 59) → ✓ (Phase B):**
- New file: `crates/ffb-mechanics/src/mechanics/path_probability.rs`
- Dijkstra max-probability path finder translated from `ffb-ai/PathProbabilityFinder.java`
- Exported types: `PlayerMoveContext`, `PathContext`, `OpponentOnField`, `PathEntry`
- Main function: `find_all_paths(player, field) → HashMap<FieldCoordinate, PathEntry>`
- `PlayerMoveContext`: start, MA, current_move, agility, strength, rules, TwoHeads, ignore_tz, BreakTackle, gfi_modifier_total, extra_gfi (for Sprint)
- `PathContext`: occupied HashSet + Vec<OpponentOnField> (with has_tackle_zones, has_diving_tackle, has_prehensile_tail, has_disturbing_presence, is_titchy)
- Algorithm: Dijkstra max-heap; `needs_dodge` = TZ adjacent to source; `dodge_modifier` = TZ at dest + DivingTackle/PrehensileTail at source + DP near dest; dodge target via BB2016 table or BB2020 direct formula; BreakTackle uses ST-based alternative when lower; GFI kicks in when `current_move + step > MA`; max steps = MA - current_move + MAX_GFI(+extra_gfi)
- 20 Rust tests covering: prob helpers (4 tests), empty-field baseline, MA/GFI limits, TwoHeads, BreakTackle, dodge BB2016/BB2020 formula helpers, ignore_tz, blocked squares, path reconstruction, Dijkstra finds best path around obstacle

**Remaining `~` in Section 4:** IDs 30–34, Roster row.

---

### Session 30 Summary

Achieved 100/100 parity. Root cause was a missing BB2025 "Inaccurate Pass or Scatter" +1 modifier in the Rust CSTI (CatchScatterThrowIn) loop for CATCH_SCATTER mode.

**BB2025 CATCH_SCATTER modifier fix (engine):**
- Java `CatchModifierCollection` adds +1 to min_roll for `CATCH_SCATTER` and `CATCH_BOMB` modes
- Rust CSTI loop used the same min_roll for first catch (CATCH_KICKOFF) and subsequent catches after bounces (CATCH_SCATTER)
- Fix: added `is_scatter: bool` to the `check_and_catch` closure; `scatter_mod = if is_scatter { 1 } else { 0 }` added to min_roll; `is_scatter = true` set after first bounce
- Effect: min_roll for lineman (agility=3, tz=0) rises from 3 to 4 for CATCH_SCATTER, matching Java exactly
- Parity advanced from 87/100 → 100/100

**Kickoff timeout test correction:**
- `kickoff_timeout_grants_team_with_fewer_turns_left_reroll` was wrong — Java BB2020 `handleTimeout()` only adjusts turn counters, never grants rerolls
- Renamed and rewrote as `kickoff_timeout_emits_event_and_no_rerolls_granted` verifying correct behavior

**COMPONENTS.md:** Parity row updated to 100/100 ✓; section 14 row 70 flipped to `100/100 ✓`.

---

### Session 29 Summary

Implemented Trickster (section 7f) — the last unimplemented skill in section 7. All section 7 skills are now ✓ or —.

**Trickster (Group 234, 4 engine tests):**
- Defender with Trickster + standing + free adjacent square + no BallAndChain → SkillUse prompt before block
- Accepted: defender moves 1 adjacent square (ball follows if carried), then block resumes
- Declined: Trickster marked used, block resumes normally
- BallAndChain cancels Trickster (no offer)
- Implementation: `PendingTrickster` struct, `pending_trickster` field on GameEngine, check in `apply_block` after DumpOff, `UseSkill { Trickster }` handler, `Action::TricksterMove { coord }` action variant, `AgentPrompt::TricksterMove { player_id, squares }` prompt variant
- Network encoder: `TricksterMove → ClientMove`

**COMPONENTS.md:** Trickster 7f `~` → `✓`. All section 7 now complete.

### Session 25 Summary

Completed Phases A–G of the cross-repo parity plan: value types, utilities, data model, and enum boosts.

**Rust enum boosts** (matching Java scenarios):
- `block.rs`: +8 tests → 10 total; ALL CAPS names confirmed; ID 7 → ✓
- `injury.rs`: +12 tests → 15 total; BrokenNeck → Ag bug fixed; ID 8 → ✓
- `skill.rs`: +3 tests → 18 total; ID 9 → ✓
- `team.rs`: +7 tests → 20 total; ID 10 → ✓
- `apothecary.rs`: +2 tests → 15 total; ID 13 → ✓
- `client.rs`: +2 tests → 9 total; ID 14 → ✓
- `net.rs`: +6 tests → 16 total; ID 15 → ✓
- `card.rs`: +8 tests → 17 total; ID 18 → ✓
- Total model crate: 276 → 340 tests (+64)

**Rust value type / model boosts:**
- `field_coordinate.rs`: +6 tests → 15 total
- `constants.rs`: +4 tests → 4 total (new test module)
- `block_types.rs`: +2 tests → 5 total
- `team.rs` (model): +2 tests → 4 total
- `field_model.rs`: +1 test → 4 total
- `game.rs`: +2 tests → 4 total

**Java test classes written** (in `ffb-server/src/test/java/com/fumbbl/ffb/server/`):
- `model/GameConstantsTest.java` — 4 tests (field dimensions, endzone bounds)
- `model/MoveSquareTest.java` — 6 tests (MoveSquare, PushbackSquare, RangeRuler)
- `model/BlockRollTest.java` — 5 tests
- `model/ReRollOptionsTest.java` — 4 tests
- `model/PlayerModelTest.java` — 5 tests (uses RosterPlayer concrete subclass)
- `util/StringToolTest.java` — 5 tests
- `skill/YoinkSkillTest.java` — 4 tests
- `skill/DrunkardSkillTest.java` — 4 tests
- `skill/PlagueRiddenSkillTest.java` — 4 tests
- 38 × `skill/*SkillTest.java` for 7g mixed/special skills — 4 tests each (152 tests total)

**Marked ✓:** IDs 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 (PassingDistance, already ≥ Java), 13, 14, 15, 18, 22, 24, 35 (Modifier System)

**Remaining work:**
- Section 2: IDs 20–21 (FieldCoordinate — Rust 15 vs Java 18, need 3 more), 23 (MoveSquare — need Rust tests for Java scenarios), 25 (ReRollOptions — Rust 3 vs Java 4)
- Section 3: ID 26 (GameRng — ffb-ai not accessible from test classpath; skip for now)
- Section 4: IDs 30–34 model classes (no Java test due to factory constructor requirements)
- Parity seeds 57–100 (blocked by Sweltering Heat halftime RNG issue)

### Session 24 Summary

Added comprehensive enum test coverage across both repos (Phase 1 of the cross-repo parity plan):

**Java test classes written/verified** (in `ffb-server/src/test/java/com/fumbbl/ffb/server/model/`):
- `DirectionTest.java` — 14 tests
- `GameStatusTest.java` — 9 tests
- `TurnModeTest.java` — 16 tests
- `SkillEnumTest.java` — 18 tests (SkillCategory, SkillUsageType, DeclareCondition)
- `TeamEnumTest.java` — 20 tests (BoxType, SendToBoxReason, TeamStatus)
- `ApothecaryEnumTest.java` — 15 tests (ApothecaryMode, ApothecaryStatus, ApothecaryType)
- `ClientStateIdTest.java` — 9 tests
- `NetEnumTest.java` — 16 tests (NetCommandId, ServerStatus, LeaderState)
- `PlayerEnumTest.java` — 15 tests (PlayerGender, PlayerType)
- `PlayerActionTest.java` — 29 tests (new file)
- `ReRollEnumTest.java` — 9 tests (ReRollProperty)
- `CardEnumTest.java` — 17 tests (CardEffect, CardTarget)

**Rust enum tests added** (matching Java scenarios):
- `direction.rs`: +7 tests → 13 total
- `game.rs`: +7 tests → 9 total
- `turn.rs`: +13 tests → 16 total
- `skill.rs`: +12 tests → 15 total
- `team.rs`: +11 tests → 13 total
- `apothecary.rs`: +11 tests → 13 total
- `client.rs`: +5 tests → 7 total
- `net.rs`: +8 tests → 10 total
- `player.rs`: +17 tests → 40 total
- `reroll.rs`: +6 tests → 9 total
- `card.rs`: +7 tests → 9 total
- Total model crate: 172 → 276 tests (+104)

**COMPONENTS.md documentation debt resolved:**
- All skill rows (7a–7g) updated with correct Java test counts (0 → 4 per skill)
- Skills with engine ✓ + Java tests + SKILL_TABLE Rust tests now marked ✓
- Enum rows (IDs 1–18) updated with new test counts and status
- Summary section updated: 2,049 Rust / ~2,128 Java @Test annotations

**Remaining work:**
- Phase 2: Value type tests (IDs 20–25) — FieldCoordinate, constants, block types, reroll options
- Phase 3: Utility tests (IDs 26–27) — GameRng, StringTool/UtilPassing
- Phase 4: Data model tests (IDs 29–34) — Player, Team, FieldModel, Game, etc.
- Phase 5: Modifier system parity audit (21 Java vs 25 Rust)
- Missing Java skill tests: Drunkard, PlagueRidden, Yoink + ~30 7g skills
- Parity seeds 57–100 (deferred — blocked by Sweltering Heat halftime RNG issue)

### Session 23 Summary

Added 4 Rust `#[test]` entries per skill for all 149 previously-untested skills in `crates/ffb-mechanics/src/skills/mod.rs`. Tests cover: `class_name`, `category`, edition membership, and `from_class_name` round-trip. Total new tests: 596 (mechanics went from ~430 → 1,026). All 1,946 workspace tests pass.

**Remaining work:**
- Parity seeds 57–100 (deferred — seed 57 blocked by Sweltering Heat halftime RNG issue)

### Session 22 Summary

Wrote Java unit tests (4 @Test each) for ~150 additional skills across all editions. Pattern: `getName()`, `getCategory()`, `hasSkillProperty(NamedProperties.X)` or `getSkillProperties() != null`, and `@RulesCollection` annotation (or `getClass().getSimpleName()` for mixed multi-edition skills).


### Session 21 Summary

**Parity: 56/100 seeds passing** (up from 0/100).

Root cause of seed 57 failure (and all higher seeds that roll SwelteringHeat):
- Java `StepEndTurn.getFaintingCount()` (bb2025) consumes 3 extra game-RNG dice at halftime when weather = `SWELTERING_HEAT` (2d6=2):
  - `d3` = fainting count
  - `d(on_pitch_size)` × fainting_count for home team
  - `d(on_pitch_size)` × fainting_count for away team
- This creates a 3-die RNG offset that shifts all subsequent dice rolls (H2 kickoff scatter, kickoff result, CSTI bounce).
- Fix applied to `ffb-engine/src/engine/mod.rs` halftime block: consume matching dice in the Rust engine when `self.game.weather == Weather::SwelteringHeat`.
- Seeds 1–56 confirmed passing (none rolled SwelteringHeat). Seed 57 still fails under investigation — fix may have a stale-build issue or secondary divergence source.

Full dice sequence for seed 57 (confirmed from Java DICE_TRACE):
- pos 1-2: d3 fans (StepSpectators)
- pos 3-4: d6 weather → sum=2=SwelteringHeat
- pos 5: d2 coin (StepCoinChoice)
- pos 6-7: d8+d6 H1 kickoff scatter (SW, dist 3)
- pos 8-9: 2×d6 H1 kickoff result (sum=10=Charge)
- pos 10: d3 Charge roll (StepApplyKickoffResult)
- pos 11: d8 H1 CSTI bounce (WEST: 22,13→21,13)
- pos 12: d3=1 HALFTIME fainting count
- pos 13: d11=8 HALFTIME home player select
- pos 14: d11=3 HALFTIME away player select
- pos 15-16: d8+d6 H2 kickoff scatter
- pos 17-18: 2×d6 H2 kickoff result
- pos 19: d8 H2 CSTI bounce

## Session 12 Additions

### New Behaviors Implemented

**Leap/Pogo/PogoStick fall injury** — Failed leap now calls `apply_fall_injury` (was incorrectly just setting player to PRONE without any armor/injury roll). Both the immediate-fail path and the reroll-declined path are fixed.

**Dodge fail injury** — Failed dodge (both immediate fail with no reroll and reroll-declined) now calls `apply_fall_injury`.

**GFI fail injury** — Failed GFI (both immediate fail with no reroll and reroll-declined) now calls `apply_fall_injury`.

**`apply_fall_injury` helper** — New centralized method used by all fall paths. Handles: armor roll (with Stunty modifier), injury roll (with Niggling), ThickSkull downgrade, Decay upgrade, Regeneration, serious injury roll, SPP for attacker (when applicable), apothecary eligibility.

**When armor holds during a fall** — `apply_fall_injury` now sets player state to PRONE (stunned) even when armor isn't broken, emitting an `Injury` event with only the armor roll.

**BreatheFire (BB2020+)** — Full implementation:
- Roll 6: KNOCK_DOWN — defender takes full armor+injury roll
- Roll 1 or effective 1: FAILURE — attacker burns themselves (armor+injury), turnover
- Effective roll < 4: NO_EFFECT
- Effective roll 4-5: PRONE — defender placed prone, no armor roll
- Defender with ST > 4: effective roll = roll - 1
- `BreatheFireRoll` event added to `GameEvent` enum
- `Action::BreatheFire { target_id }` added to Action enum
- `PlayerActionChoice::BreatheFire` added
- Wired in `ActivatePlayer` handler and standalone `Action::BreatheFire` handler

**Pogo/PogoStick as Leap variants** — `has_leap` check extended to include `SkillId::PogoStick` and `SkillId::Pogo`.

### Bug Fixes / Correctness

- Fireball injury path: now correctly uses PS_BADLY_HURT for CAS (not PS_KNOCKED_OUT), applies ThickSkull/Decay/Regeneration/SI properly
- Lightning injury path: same improvements as fireball; +1 to armor roll (not injury)
- Crowd surf ThickSkull: ThickSkull check was missing when crowd-surfed player would be KO'd
- Stab injury path: now applies ThickSkull/Decay/Regeneration/SI/SPP properly; was missing all of these

### New Tests Added (session 12, groups 119-120)

- `pogo_allows_move_into_occupied_square`, `pogo_stick_allows_move_into_occupied_square`
- `fireball_applies_decay_and_cas_correctly`, `lightning_applies_serious_injury_on_cas`
- `stab_produces_serious_injury_on_cas`, `stab_decay_player_becomes_cas`
- `leap_into_occupied_square_fails_player_goes_prone` (updated to check Injury event + not-standing state)
- `dodge_fail_triggers_armor_roll`
- `gfi_fail_triggers_armor_roll`
- `breathe_fire_roll_6_knocks_down_defender`
- `breathe_fire_prone_result_places_defender_prone`
- `breathe_fire_failure_injures_attacker`

## Architecture

The Java server uses a ~730-file Step/Stack pattern. The Rust port uses a DIFFERENT architecture: a unified `GameEngine` state machine in `ffb-engine/src/engine/mod.rs` (~18,400+ lines). There is no 1:1 file mapping.

**Crate structure:**
- `ffb-model` — enums, types, data model structs
- `ffb-mechanics` — pure computation functions
- `ffb-engine` — GameEngine state machine, Action enum, RandomAgent
- `ffb-protocol` — JSON serialization
- `ffb-client` — WebSocket connection
- `ffb-parity` — Java vs Rust comparison binary

## Events Emitted by Engine

**Emitted:** Most game events including: BlockRoll, DodgeRoll, GoForItRoll, CatchRoll, PassRoll, InterceptionRoll, PlayerFellDown, PlayerMoved, BallPickedUp, BallScattered, Touchdown, Injury, Pushback, ScatterBall, ScatterPlayer, ThrowIn, KickoffScatter, ReRoll, SkillUse, PlayerAction, StartHalf, ReceiveChoice, WinningsRoll, ApothecaryChoice, WizardUse, SwarmingPlayersRoll, WeepingDaggerRoll, AnimalSavagery, SafeThrowRoll, SwoopPlayer, ThrowTeamMateRoll, BombExplodesAfterCatch, BombOutOfBounds, BreatheFireRoll

**Not yet emitted:** RiotousRookies, ThenIStartedBlastin, CardDeactivated, CardEffectRoll, DefectingPlayers, PassBlock (event, not action), PettyCash, DoubleHiredStarPlayer, GameOptions, TimeoutEnforced

- `cargo` must run from PowerShell or `~/.cargo/bin/cargo` in Git Bash (not on PATH in Bash)
- **Sections 1–12 are now complete** — all rows ✓ or —.
- Events not yet emitted in Rust engine: `DefectingPlayers` (post-match illegal-concession, edge case), `TimeoutEnforced` (network CLIENT_ILLEGAL_PROCEDURE command, not applicable to headless engine). `PettyCash` ✓ emitted since session 33. `DoubleHiredStarPlayer` ✓ emitted when both teams buy the same star player (session 37).
- NurglesRot: post-match roster flag only — marked `—`, no engine behavior needed
- Section 13 (Network Protocol): 6 of 7 rows ✓; ID 61 ClientConnection ~ (async WebSocket, no unit tests); ID 71 Network integration test ○ (stub in ffb-parity/src/network_test.rs)

## Runtime Notes

- `cargo` requires PowerShell (not Git Bash)
- Run tests: `cargo test --workspace` from `C:\Users\Admin\niels\ffb-rust`
- Or: `/c/Users/Admin/.cargo/bin/cargo test --workspace --manifest-path /c/Users/Admin/niels/ffb-rust/Cargo.toml`
- Java source: `C:\Users\Admin\niels\ffb\ffb-server\src\main\java\com\fumbbl\ffb\server\`
