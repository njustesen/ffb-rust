# FFB Java to Rust 1:1 Translation Tracker

<!-- Auto-generated skeleton from Java source. Update status cells manually as files are translated. -->
<!-- To regenerate: python scripts/gen_translation_tracker.py -->

## How to Use

This file tracks every Java class in ffb-common, ffb-server, and ffb-client-logic against its target Rust file.

1. When you start translating a file: change its status to `~`
2. When it matches the Java source 1:1 and parity is confirmed: change to `✓`
3. When a race passes T3b 100/100, all files exercised by that race should be `✓`

**Workflow per Java file:**
- Read the Java source in `ffb-java/<module>/src/main/java/<path>.java`
- Find or create the corresponding Rust file at the listed Rust Target path
- Translate method by method, matching dice consumption order, conditions, and state transitions exactly
- Run `cargo test` after each file
- Run `python scripts/parity_run.py --home amazon --away amazon --seeds 1-10` to catch regressions

## Status Legend

- `○` Not started -- no Rust equivalent exists
- `~` Partial -- Rust equivalent exists but not yet 1:1 with Java
- `✓` Done -- Rust matches Java line-by-line, parity confirmed
- `—` Not translating — AWT/Swing GUI only (`ffb-client` Java module, ~81 files). DB, WebSocket, cache, replay are all in scope.

## Progress Summary

**Phase ZW.3 + ZW.4 (client/report renderers + docs closeout, completed, 2026-07-11):**
Translated the last major `ffb-client-logic` block: all 211 `client/report/*Message.java`
report-to-text renderers (55 root + 32 `bb2016/` + 26 `bb2020/` + 39 `bb2025/` + 57
`mixed/`), each a `ReportMessage` trait impl that builds styled text runs from an
already-translated `ffb-model` report object. Five batches translated in parallel
(one per subdirectory, isolated git worktrees), then merged and reconciled.

Prerequisite fix found before the batch could start: `client/StatusReport.java` (279
lines, the shared rendering sink every message calls through) was still a 10-line stub,
and its two style enums — `TextStyle`, `ParagraphStyle` — had been bulk-marked `—`
(permanent Swing skip) during the ZW.0 audit, mis-lumped in with genuinely-Swing root
files like `FontCache`/`IconCache` despite being plain 22-line string-keyed enums with
zero AWT dependency. Un-skipped both enums and gave `StatusReport` a real translation:
its one actual Swing call (`getUserInterface().getLog().append(...)`) became a headless
`rendered_runs: Vec<RenderedRun>` capture, making every renderer's output assertable in a
unit test without any UI. `ReportMessageBase` became a `ReportMessage` trait (Rust has no
inheritance); `ReportMessageType`'s annotation-based dispatch became a `report_id()`
method per renderer (Java's reflection-based `Scanner` registry has no faithful Rust
equivalent, so this is a mechanical substitution, not new logic).

Small legitimate gaps filled in `ffb-model` along the way (methods present on the Java
enums but not yet ported): `PlayerGender::dative()`/`self_word()`/`verb_form()` and
`PlayerAction::description()`, transcribed directly from `PlayerGender.java`/
`PlayerAction.java`. Where a renderer depended on data the report layer doesn't retain
(e.g. `RollModifier` magnitude/sign — the model only keeps resolved modifier *names*,
per the Phase ZU report-serialization decision) or on unported mechanic/factory lookups,
each file documents the gap inline with a `// java: <call>` comment rather than
fabricating values — see individual batch commits for the full list per file.

Tests: 16,412 → 17,305 (+893: ~250 root, ~126 bb2016, ~105 bb2020, ~179 bb2025, plus
mixed and the prerequisite files). `cargo test --workspace` green, `client/report/` (211
files) + the 5 prerequisite files now genuinely `✓`. This completes Phase ZW's
translation scope: **all 373 in-scope `ffb-client-logic` files are now genuinely
translated** (`client/model`, `client/util`, `client/factory`, `client/net`,
`client/handler`, `client/` root, `client/state/` 85 files, `client/report/` 211 files).
Remaining `—` rows (271 files, Swing dialog/ui/layer/animation/overlay/sound rendering)
stay permanently skipped per the ZW plan's triage. No parity work this phase, as planned.

**Phase ZW.2c (NetCommand wire-protocol layer, completed, 2026-07-10):** closed the blocker
Batch B flagged (below) — and found a second, smaller instance of the ZW.0 fake-✓-stub
pattern while doing it. `net/NetCommand.java`, `net/NetCommandFactory.java`, and all 123
`net/commands/ClientCommand*.java`/`ServerCommand*.java` classes were marked `✓` in the
tracker but `net_command.rs` was a one-variant `Unknown`-only enum (not a 1:1 translation of
the abstract `NetCommand` class) and none of the 123 leaf structs had `toJsonValue()`/
`initFrom()` — a ~126-file pocket of quietly-fake `✓` rows inside the previously-"genuinely
done" common+server count. Fixed for real this session:
- `net_command.rs` rewritten as a genuine `NetCommand` trait (`get_id()`/`get_context()`/
  `is_internal()`), matching Java's abstract class.
- `ClientCommand`/`ServerCommand` base structs got real `base_json_fields()`/
  `base_from_json()` helpers (entropy/command_nr + the shared `netCommandId` key).
- All 91 `ClientCommand*`/32 `ServerCommand*` leaf structs got the missing inherited
  `entropy`/`command_nr` field, a `NetCommand` impl, and real `to_json_value()`/`from_json()`
  matching Java's `toJsonValue()`/`initFrom()` field-for-field (wire keys verified against
  `IJsonOption.java`, not guessed) — following the Phase ZU report-serialization convention
  (manual `serde_json::json!` + manual field extraction + round-trip test per file).
- `AnyClientCommand`/`AnyServerCommand` (`ffb-protocol/src/commands/any_{client,server}
  _command.rs`) — real sum types mirroring `NetCommandId.createNetCommand()`'s switch, each
  implementing `NetCommand` and a `from_json(id, json)` dispatch constructor.
- `NetCommandFactory::for_json_value()` — the real `forJsonValue()` dispatch (reads
  `netCommandId`, routes to `AnyClientCommand`/`AnyServerCommand::from_json`). Added
  `NetCommandId::from_name()` (reverse of the pre-existing `name()`) to `ffb-model` to support
  this. This is additive: the pre-existing hand-rolled `client_commands`/`server_commands`
  simplification that the live WebSocket layer (`connection`, `network_encoder`) depends on
  today is untouched — reconciling the two hierarchies stays a separate, later, riskier
  decision (same treatment as other live-infra deferrals since Phase ZW.1).
- Unblocked `client/net/` (3 files: `ClientCommunication`'s ~90 `send*` methods, `ClientPingTask`,
  `CommandEndpoint`) and `client/handler/` (27 files: the incoming-`ServerCommand` dispatch
  factory + one handler per command, confusingly named `ClientCommandHandler*` in Java) — both
  translated for real this session, replacing all remaining PascalCase stub duplicates in
  those two directories.

Tests: 14,940 → 15,647 (+707: ~500 from the 123 struct JSON methods, ~10 from the dispatch
layer, +91 from `client/net`, +233 from `client/handler` minus the pre-existing 60). All of
`ffb-client-logic`'s `client/net/` and `client/handler/` directories (30 files) are now
genuinely `✓`, on top of the 126-file protocol-layer honesty fix. Remaining `ffb-client-logic`
`○` work: `client/state/` (85 files) and `client/report/` (211 files) — unchanged from
`docs/PHASE_ZW_PLAN.md`'s existing plan, recommended next.

**Phase ZW.0 (tracker truth reset, 2026-07-10):** the 644 `ffb-client-logic` rows were
previously all marked `✓` despite their Rust targets being ~10-line placeholder stubs, not
translations (spot check: `client/ActionKeyBindings.java` is 191 lines of key-binding logic;
its Rust file was an empty struct). `scripts/audit_client_stubs.py` reclassified all 644 rows
by directory: `dialog/`, `ui/`, `layer/`, `overlay/`, `sound/` (257 files) plus 22 root-level
Swing/AWT files (`ActionKey*`, `ClientLayout`, `Component`, `*DimensionProvider`,
`FantasyFootballClient`, `FieldComponent`, `FontCache`, `GameTitle`, `IconCache`,
`LayoutSettings`, `ParagraphStyle`, `RenderContext`, `StyleProvider`, `TextStyle`,
`UtilStyle`) → **279 files marked `—`** (no headless equivalent, permanent skip). The
remaining **365 files** (`animation/`, `factory/`, `handler/`, `model/`, `net/`, `report/`,
`state/`, `util/`, plus 9 root logic files: `ClientData`, `ClientParameters`,
`ClientReplayer`, `CoordinateConverter`, `IProgressListener`, `PlayerIconFactory`,
`ReplayControl`, `StatusReport`, `UserInterface`) → **marked `○` (not started)**, pending real
translation in ZW.2/ZW.3. No Rust code changed this step — bookkeeping only. Honest totals:

| Metric | Count (at ZW.0, before any translation) | Count (after ZW.2 Batch A) |
|--------|---|---|
| Total Java files tracked | 2979 | 2979 |
| Genuinely done (✓, common + server) | 2278 | 2278 |
| Genuinely done (✓, ffb-client-logic) | 0 | 7 |
| Not started (○, ffb-client-logic real translation, was falsely ✓) | 365 | 351 |
| Partial (~, all ffb-server infra — genuine subsystem gaps, see Phase ZW.1 note below) | 11 | 11 |
| Not translating (—, 46 server/common GUI-adjacent + 279/286 ffb-client-logic Swing/AWT) | 325 | 332 |

**Phase ZW.1 (server closeout, 2026-07-10):** closed 24 of the 35 `~` `ffb-server` rows —
the 4 missing lower-level APIs (`SoundId::all()` visibility, a real `GameOptionId` enum +
`GameOptionFactory`, `SeriousInjuryFactory`), all 6 `net/` servlet+background-task stubs
(plus a previously entirely-missing `ServerCommunication::send_to_replay_session`), and 14
of the 25 DB/HTTP-dependent handlers (including all 6 sketch handlers via the new
replay-broadcast wiring). The remaining **11 handlers stay `~` for a genuine reason, not a
narrow gap**: `add_loaded_team`, `close_game`, `fumbbl_game_checked`, `fumbbl_team_loaded`,
`join`, `join_approved`, `join_replay`, `schedule_game`, `upload_game`, `replay`,
`replay_loaded` each bottom out in a whole unported Java subsystem — `GameCache
.addTeamToGame` (team/roster/box-placement mutation), `RosterCache`/`TeamCache`,
`UtilServerStartGame.startGame`, `ReplayCache`/`ReplayState`/`ServerSketchManager`, or a full
replay-playback engine (`UtilServerReplay.startServerReplay`) — confirmed against the real
Java source, not assumed. Building those is real follow-up work, not a bounded-session task.
Tests: 14,794 → 14,911 (+117).

By LOC (recomputed in ZW.0 from actual per-directory Java LOC, not the earlier estimate):
GUI-skip is 279 files / ~33.8k LOC (dialog 17,993 + ui 9,316 + layer 1,971 + overlay 320 +
sound 188 + ~22 root GUI files ~3,991); real client logic to translate is 365 files /
~26.7k LOC (animation 1,325 + factory 40 + handler 1,659 + model 312 + net 794 +
report 9,187 + state 10,868 + util 858 + 9 root logic files ~1,631). In-scope Java
(common + server + client-logic-to-translate, excluding GUI/Swing app/tools) is therefore
~235.2k, not the prior ~238k estimate. **~88% of in-scope Java is genuinely translated**
(~207k of ~235.2k; ~74% of all 279k — this % is unchanged since no code moved, only the
denominator was corrected). Plan: `docs/PHASE_ZW_PLAN.md`.

**Phase ZW.2 Batch B follow-up (net/, completed, 2026-07-10):** the prerequisite flagged in
the original Batch B note below — a real dispatch/serialization layer over the 92 genuine
`ClientCommand*` structs — was built earlier this session (`commands::any_client_command`,
`commands::any_server_command`, `net_command_factory::NetCommandFactory`), so all 3
`client/net/` files were revisited and translated. `ClientCommunication.java`'s ~90 `send*`
methods now each construct the real, field-for-field-correct `ClientCommand*` struct and call
its genuine `.to_json_value()`; `ServerConnection::send` still only accepts the old hand-rolled
`ffb_protocol::client_commands::ClientCommand` enum, so the JSON is pushed onto a
`Vec<serde_json::Value>` outbox rather than a live socket — a documented, explicit follow-up
(not a silent fork), same "two parallel command hierarchies" gap as before, now isolated to
just the last-mile transport instead of the whole construction layer. Several `getClient()`-
sourced values (client mode, coach name, entropy) became explicit parameters since
`FantasyFootballClient` is the permanently-skipped GUI shell; `TeamSetup`'s missing
player-number/coordinate fields and `Sketch`'s missing `id` field (both pre-existing model
simplifications) meant `sendTeamSetupSave`/`sendAddSketch` also take extra explicit params.
`ClientPingTask` translated directly (`tick(is_open, communication, now)`, no live timer per
project's `TimerTask` convention). `CommandEndpoint`: real socket I/O is already covered by
`connection::ServerConnection` (`tokio-tungstenite`, per original note below); translated the
pure logic that IS extractable (compression-flag parsing, `isOpen()` state, the pong
ping-time arithmetic) as a standalone testable method. New files: `client/net/mod.rs`,
`client_communication.rs`, `client_ping_task.rs`, `command_endpoint.rs` (replacing the 3
orphaned PascalCase stubs); `pub mod net;` added to `client/mod.rs`. Tests: 15,474 → 15,565
(+91, all in `ffb-client`).

**Phase ZW.2 Batch B (net/, investigated, blocked, 2026-07-10):** all 3 `client/net/` files
bottom out in real gaps, not narrow ones. `ClientCommunication.java` (597 lines, ~90 `send*`
methods) needs a genuine `ClientCommand` dispatch enum over the **already-existing 92
`ffb-protocol/src/commands/client_command_*.rs` structs** — those structs are a faithful
field-for-field 1:1 translation of Java's real `com.fumbbl.ffb.net.commands.ClientCommand*`
classes (verified: `ClientCommandEndTurn` has `turn_mode`/`player_coordinates` matching Java's
`turnMode`/`playerCoordinates` exactly), but **no enum wraps them for dispatch, and no JSON
wire serialization exists for them yet** (no `to_json_value`/`from_json`, unlike the Phase ZU
report files). What `ServerConnection`/`network_encoder` actually use today is a second,
parallel `ffb-protocol/src/client_commands::ClientCommand` enum — a hand-rolled, **not 1:1**
simplification (invented field shapes, e.g. `ClientBuyInducements.purchases: Vec<(String,
i32)>` has no Java equivalent) built to get the WebSocket layer working without doing the
full per-class translation. This is the same "two parallel command hierarchies" gap flagged
since Phase ZV and never resolved. `ClientPingTask.java` and `CommandEndpoint.java` both also
depend on `FantasyFootballClient` (permanently-skipped GUI shell); `CommandEndpoint`'s actual
networking role is already covered by `connection::ServerConnection` (necessarily a different
tech stack — `tokio-tungstenite` vs. Java's `javax.websocket` — not a 1:1 line translation
candidate). **Sizing:** building a genuine `ClientCommand` dispatch enum over the 92 real
structs and translating `ClientCommunication`'s ~90 methods against it is comparable in scope
to Phase ZU's 191-file report-serialization phase — a dedicated sub-phase, not foldable into
this batch. All 3 files marked `~` (not `○`, not skipped) pending that prerequisite work.
Recommended next-session focus; not started this session.

**Phase ZW.2 Batch A (client core translation start, 2026-07-10):** translated the first 7
files: `client/model/` (4: `ChangeList`, `ControlAware`, `OnlineAware`, `VersionChangeList`)
and 2 of 11 `client/util/` files (`UtilClientActionKeys` → `action_keys.rs`, `UtilClientChat`
→ `chat.rs`, text-manipulation half only — its Swing `JTextComponent` half has no headless
equivalent). **Major discovery: the entire `crates/ffb-client/src/client/` tree (649 files,
including all 644 tracker rows) was never declared as a module anywhere — not wired into
`lib.rs`, so none of it compiled or ran, the same dead-code pattern found in `ffb-server/net/`
during Phase ZW.1.** Added `pub mod client;` to `lib.rs` and built out the module tree
(`client/mod.rs`, `client/model/mod.rs`, `client/util/mod.rs`) from scratch as files are
translated — snake_case filenames per project convention, replacing the orphaned PascalCase
stubs outright (no coexistence step needed since nothing referenced them). **Triage
correction found while translating:** `client/ActionKey.java` — classified `—` (GUI) in ZW.0
by directory-membership heuristic — is actually a plain enum with no Swing/AWT dependency
(keybinding identifiers + property-name strings); reclassified to `✓` and translated, since
`UtilClientActionKeys` genuinely needs it. **8 of the 11 `util/` files turned out to be
GUI-coupled despite `util/` being classified wholesale as logic in ZW.0** — `MarkerService`
(JDialog/JPanel), `MouseEntropySource` (AWT `MouseEvent`/`SwingUtilities`), `UtilClientCursor`
(AWT `Cursor`/`Toolkit`), `UtilClientGraphics` (`Graphics2D`), `UtilClientJTable` (Swing
`JTable`), `UtilClientPlayerDrag` (mouse-drag pixel math tied to `FantasyFootballClient`/
`UserInterface` rendering), `UtilClientReflection` (Java-version/Swing-JTable-reflection
workarounds with no Rust equivalent), `UtilClientThrowTeamMate` (pure UI-redraw trigger) —
reclassified `○`→`—`. `UtilClientTimeout` and `factory/LogicPluginFactory` stay `○` but are
**deferred**, not translated this batch: `UtilClientTimeout` needs the `UserInterface`/
`ClientData` headless-callback trait boundary (ZW.2 Batch D); `LogicPluginFactory` needs
`state/logic/plugin/LogicPlugin` (ZW.2 Batch E5, the last state batch) — both real dependency
gaps, confirmed against the Java source, not skipped for convenience. This is expected and
matches the plan's flagged risk that directory-level GUI/logic triage would need file-by-file
correction as translation actually touches each file. Tests: 14,911 → 14,940 (+29). Net
tracker effect: ○ 365→351 (-6 translated, -8 reclassified to —), — 279→286 (-1 reclassified
to ✓, +8 reclassified from ○), ✓ (client-logic) 0→7.

## Session History

| Session | Date | Tests | DEFERREDs | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Phase VIII | 2026-07-04 | 8,064 | ~540 | Modifier factory wiring complete (ArmorModifierFactory, InjuryModifierFactory, injury type wiring) |
| Phase IX | 2026-07-05 | 8,149 | 540 | DEFERRED sweep complete; remaining DEFERREDs blocked by dialog/report/card/persistence infrastructure |
| Phase X | 2026-07-05 | 8,775 | ~525 | Report system (~183 new report files, ~586 tests), SkillFactory (222-skill HashMap, 22 tests), dialog wiring (show_dialog/hide_dialog, 4 sites wired), step completions (step_reset_to_move, state_mechanic chef rolls, step_right_stuff BB2025, step_quick_bite adjacent-opponent branch). Functional completeness: 82% → ~85%. |
| Phase ZT | 2026-07-09 | 12,451 (start) | ~52 | Stub implementation sweep; TRACKER updated: 412 server/report entries moved from — to ○ |
| Phase ZU | 2026-07-10 | 14,322 | ~221 | Report serialization: 191 report files fully translated (fields, getters, to_json_value/from_json, round-trip tests) into `ffb-model/src/report/`. TRACKER had not been updated for this — corrected in Phase ZV below. |
| Phase ZV (start) | 2026-07-10 | 14,341 | 221 | Tracker correction: flipped 191 report rows ○→✓ (crate column corrected `ffb-server`→`ffb-model`); added 2 previously-missing trivial files (`ReportInjury` trait, `UtilReport` helper) discovered during the audit. Remaining 221 ○ rows are all genuine `ffb-server` handler/db/admin/request/commandline/net stubs — next up. |
| Phase ZV | 2026-07-10 | 14,794 | 35 | Real 1:1 translation of the `ffb-server` infrastructure layer, replacing `todo!()` stubs with genuine ported logic: (1) wired 5 orphaned module trees (`db`, `admin`, `request`, `commandline`, remaining `handler/` + `net/commands` files) into `lib.rs`/`mod.rs` so their code and tests actually compile/run; (2) ported `handler/*.rs` (36 files) and `handler/talk/*.rs` (70 files) — session/coach/game bookkeeping, talk-command dispatch, sketch/marker/replay handling — using `GameCache`/`SessionManager`/`ReplaySessionManager`; (3) ported `db/` (29 files: base registry classes + `query/`/`insert/`/`update/`) onto real `mysql_async`-backed execution, following the pre-existing `db/delete/*.rs` pattern (added `mysql_async` as a workspace dependency); (4) ported `admin/*.rs` (8) and `request/*.rs` + `request/fumbbl/*.rs` (20) behind a new `HttpClient` trait (mockable in tests, no live network wiring yet); (5) refactored `ServerCommandHandlerFactory` to delegate `ClientPing` to the real `ServerCommandHandlerPing` (documented remaining delegation as blocked on a pre-existing split between two parallel `ffb_protocol` command-type hierarchies — a real architectural gap, not fixed this phase); (6) expanded `net/wire.rs`'s `GameEvent → WireReport` coverage from 18 to 114 of ~128 variants, and added `net/wire_prompt.rs` — the previously entirely-missing `AgentPrompt → WireDialog` outgoing-encoding direction, covering all 35 `AgentPrompt` variants (unverified against a literal Java wire-format source, since no equivalent `ServerCommandSetDialogParameter`-style class exists in `ffb-java`; documented as a best-effort design following the `WireReport` convention). Tests: 12,451 → 14,794 (+2,343). **Remaining `~` (35 files, all genuinely infra-gated, not logic gaps):** live DB connection wiring for a few handler DB calls, live HTTP wiring for FUMBBL-auth/team-loading handlers, sketch-replay-broadcast plumbing, and a handful of missing lower-level APIs (`GameState` step-stack reset, `SoundId` enumeration, `GameOptionId` enumeration, `SeriousInjuryFactory.forAttribute`). |
| Phase ZW.1 | 2026-07-10 | 14,911 | 11 | Server closeout sweep on the 35 remaining `~` files from Phase ZV. Fixed the 4 lower-level API gaps: `SoundId::all()` made `pub`; built a real `GameOptionId` enum (127 variants) + `GameOptionFactory` (127-case port of Java's `createGameOption`) + `GameOptions::get_option_with_default`; implemented `SeriousInjuryFactory` (`for_name`/`initialize`/`dead`/`poison`/`for_attribute`) via a new `AnySeriousInjury` sum type over the edition `SeriousInjury` enums — unblocked all 4 `handler/talk/*.rs` files. Implemented all 6 `net/` servlet + background-task stubs (`command_servlet`/`file_servlet` as axum routes, 3 `tokio::time::interval`-based tasks, `server_network_entropy_task` feeding a shared `Fortuna`) and discovered/fixed that none of the 6 were declared in `net/mod.rs` (dead code, never compiled into any test run). Added `ServerCommunication::send_to_replay_session`/`close`/`send_game_time` — previously entirely missing, needed by the sketch/marker/replay handler family; gave `ReplaySessionManager` real sender storage. Wired `DbConnectionManager::init_pool()` into `fantasy_football_server.rs::run()` (env-var gated) and added a real `reqwest`-backed `HttpClient` impl (mocks kept for tests). Closed 14 of 25 DB/HTTP-dependent handlers this way (`set_marker`, `password_challenge`, `user_settings`, `delete_game`, `load_automatic_player_markings`, `update_player_markings`, all 6 sketch handlers, `replay_status`) plus `db_player_markers_insert_parameter_list.rs` (needed new `FieldModel` player/field-marker fields). **11 handlers investigated and left `~` on purpose** — each needs a whole unported Java subsystem (`GameCache.addTeamToGame`, `RosterCache`/`TeamCache`, `UtilServerStartGame.startGame`, `ReplayCache`/`ReplayState`/`ServerSketchManager`, or a full `UtilServerReplay.startServerReplay` playback engine) confirmed against the real Java source — building those is real follow-up work, not this session's scope. **Major discovery (not this phase's scope, flagged for follow-up):** an audit found all 644 `ffb-client-logic` tracker rows marked `✓` are actually ~10-line placeholder stubs, not translations — see the Progress Summary correction above and `docs/PHASE_ZW_PLAN.md` for the full remediation plan (ZW.0 tracker fix, ZW.2/ZW.3 real client translation, ~373 files / ~29.3k LOC). Tests: 14,794 → 14,911 (+117). |
| Phase ZW.0 | 2026-07-10 | 14,911 | 365 | Tracker truth reset (no code changes): ran new `scripts/audit_client_stubs.py` over all 644 `ffb-client-logic` rows, reclassifying by directory. 279 files (`dialog/`, `ui/`, `layer/`, `overlay/`, `sound/`, plus 22 root Swing/AWT files) → `—` (permanent skip, no headless equivalent). 365 files (`animation/`, `factory/`, `handler/`, `model/`, `net/`, `report/`, `state/`, `util/`, plus 9 root logic files) → `○` (not started — real translation next in ZW.2/ZW.3). Recomputed in-scope LOC denominator from actual per-directory Java line counts (~235.2k, not the prior ~238k estimate): honest completeness ~88% of in-scope, ~74% of all-Java, unchanged test count. Also fixed stale `engine.rs`-as-live-path references in `docs/step_port/TESTING.md` (engine.rs was deleted in Phase ZR; driver.rs is the live path). |
| Phase ZW.2 Batch A | 2026-07-10 | 14,940 | 351 | Client core translation start: 7 files done (`model/` × 4, `util/action_keys.rs`, `util/chat.rs`, root `action_key.rs`). **Discovered the entire `crates/ffb-client/src/client/` tree (649 files) was never wired into `lib.rs`** — added `pub mod client;` and built the module tree (`client/mod.rs`, `client/model/mod.rs`, `client/util/mod.rs`) from scratch. **Triage corrections found while translating (expected — flagged as a risk in the ZW plan):** `ActionKey.java` reclassified `—`→`✓` (plain enum, no Swing dependency, needed by `UtilClientActionKeys`); 8 of 11 `util/` files reclassified `○`→`—` (Swing/AWT-coupled despite `util/` being classified wholesale as logic: `MarkerService`, `MouseEntropySource`, `UtilClientCursor`, `UtilClientGraphics`, `UtilClientJTable`, `UtilClientPlayerDrag`, `UtilClientReflection`, `UtilClientThrowTeamMate`). `UtilClientTimeout` and `factory/LogicPluginFactory` deferred (real dependency gaps: UI trait boundary, `LogicPlugin` respectively) — see Progress Summary above for detail. Tests: 14,911 → 14,940 (+29). |
| Phase ZW.2 Batch B (investigation) | 2026-07-10 | 14,940 | 351 | Investigated `client/net/` (3 files); found all 3 blocked on real gaps, not narrow ones — see Progress Summary above for full detail. Headline: `ffb-protocol` has **two parallel `ClientCommand` hierarchies** — 92 genuine 1:1-translated structs (`commands::client_command_*.rs`, unwired, no dispatch enum, no wire serialization) vs. a hand-rolled 40-variant simplification (`client_commands::ClientCommand`) that the WebSocket layer (`connection`, `network_encoder`) actually uses today. Marked all 3 net/ files `~` with the dependency documented. No code translated this step (investigation only, 0 new tests). |
| Phase ZW.2c | 2026-07-10 | 15,647 | 11 | Built the real NetCommand wire-protocol layer flagged as the ZW.2 Batch B blocker: rewrote `net_command.rs` as a genuine `NetCommand` trait; gave the 91 `ClientCommand*`/32 `ServerCommand*` structs their missing inherited field, `NetCommand` impl, and `to_json_value`/`from_json` (wire keys verified against `IJsonOption.java`); built `AnyClientCommand`/`AnyServerCommand` sum types + a real `NetCommandFactory::for_json_value` dispatch + `NetCommandId::from_name`. Along the way found a second fake-✓-stub pocket (this same ~126-file net/commands set, previously counted in the "genuinely done" common+server total) — now genuinely done. Unblocked and translated `client/net/` (3 files) and `client/handler/` (27 files), both previously PascalCase stubs. See Progress Summary above for full detail. Tests: 14,940 → 15,647 (+707). |
| Phase ZW.2 Batch C (root files, part 1) | 2026-07-11 | 15,692 | 4 | Fresh inventory found `client/state/` (85 files) hard-depends on `FantasyFootballClient` — `ClientState<T,C>` is generically parameterized over it, and `LogicModule` imports it directly; the explicit-parameter trick used for `client/net`/`client/handler` doesn't scale to the ~1,000 `client.*` call sites across 85 state files. Promoted `FantasyFootballClient` from GUI-skip to a real hybrid struct (`fantasy_football_client.rs`) holding the logic-relevant fields (`client_data`, `game`, `mode`, `parameters`, `command_handler_factory`, `communication`, `command_endpoint`) with concrete methods translated 1:1 (`gameId`, `getGame`/`setGame`, `getMode`/`setMode`, `getParameters`, `getClientData`, `getCommandHandlerFactory`, `getCommunication`, `getCommandEndpoint`, `logError`/`logDebug`); `abstract` methods with no in-scope body (AWT-client-only or `ffb-ai`-only) are omitted, not invented, per `CLAUDE.md`. `updateClientState()` deferred to Step 3 (needs `ClientState`/`ClientStateFactory`, not yet translated). Also translated `ClientData` (plain data holder), `ClientParameters` (arg parsing + validation; added `ClientModeFactory::for_argument` to `ffb-model`, the missing counterpart to the existing `for_name`), and `IProgressListener` (trait). **Triage correction:** `ClientLayout` reclassified `—`→`✓` (plain data enum, misclassified by association with the Swing code that consumes it — same pattern as the `ActionKey` correction). **Triage correction (other direction):** `CoordinateConverter` reclassified `○`→`—` — its one method takes a Swing `MouseEvent` and calls into `UiDimensionProvider`/`PitchDimensionProvider`, both genuinely Swing-scale-bound GUI-skip types, not a narrow dependency to route around. Tests: 15,647 → 15,692 (+45, incl. 6 new `ClientModeFactory` tests in `ffb-model`). |
| Phase ZW.2 Batch C (root files, part 2 — triage only) | 2026-07-11 | 15,692 | -4/+3 | Read the actual Java source for the 4 remaining Batch-1 root file candidates; all 4 turned out more Swing-coupled than the ZW.1-era bulk triage assumed (expected risk, same pattern as the ZW.2 Batch A util/ corrections). **Reclassified `○`→`—` (permanent skip):** `PlayerIconFactory` (every method is `BufferedImage`/`Graphics2D` icon compositing) and `ReplayControl` (`extends JPanel implements MouseInputListener` — a real Swing widget). **Reclassified `○`→`~` (blocked, not skip — real follow-up work, not invented):** `StatusReport` (every print routes through `getUserInterface().getLog()`, GUI; `report()` dispatches to `client/report/ReportMessageBase` renderers that don't exist yet — blocked on Phase ZW.3) and `ClientReplayer` (644 LOC, `implements ActionListener` driven by a `javax.swing.Timer`, deep `getUserInterface()` calls for playback UI, and `createGame()`/`cloneGame()` reconstruct `Game` via the Java `Game(IFactorySource, FactoryManager)` constructor shape that this project's ported `Game::new(home, away, rules)` doesn't support — same gap documented in `fantasy_football_client.rs`'s doc comment). `client/state/` calls `getReplayer()` 24× — likely only needs a small logic-only subset (`isReplaying`/`hasControl`/replay-speed state), which is real follow-up work once `client/state/` translation surfaces exactly which methods are actually called, not before. No code changes this step (triage/tracker only); Batch 1's 9 candidate root files are now fully resolved: 5 translated (Batch C part 1), 2 confirmed permanent-skip, 2 documented-blocked. |
| Phase ZW.2 Batch D (state/interaction, part 1) | 2026-07-11 | 15,713 | 4 | Started translating `client/state/` (previously entirely unwired PascalCase stubs): translated the 2 prerequisite value types (`ClientAction` — 54-variant plain enum; `Influences` — 7-variant enum whose `get_influenced_actions()` maps each variant to its Java-hardcoded `ClientAction` list) plus `logic/interaction/ActionContext` (mutable `actions`/`influences`/`block_alternatives` lists with `add_*`/`merge`) and `logic/interaction/InteractionResult` (`Kind` enum + builder-style `with_*` methods + static factories `delegate`/`select_action`/`invalid`/`reset`/`perform`/`ignore`/`handled`/`preview_throw`). Built the module tree from scratch (`client/state/mod.rs`, `client/state/logic/mod.rs`, `client/state/logic/interaction/mod.rs`) and wired `pub mod state;` into `client/mod.rs`; only these 4 modules are declared so far, the other 81 stub files in the tree remain orphaned on disk for future batches. Tests: 15,692 → 15,713 (+21). |
| Phase ZW.2 Batch D (state/plugin) | 2026-07-11 | 15,734 | 10 | Translated `client/state/logic/plugin/` (10 files on disk — the plan's estimate of 13 was off by 3; no `plugin/` root files beyond the 4 actually confirmed). `LogicPlugin` → trait + top-level `LogicPluginType` enum (nested Java `Type` has no Rust nested-type equivalent); `BaseLogicPlugin`/`BlockLogicExtensionPlugin`/`MoveLogicPlugin` (root abstract classes) → traits, the latter two generic over the still-unwired `BlockLogicExtension`/`MoveLogicModule` logic-module types (default `()`) since those remain PascalCase stub files not yet declared in `logic/mod.rs` (blocked on the not-yet-translated `LogicModule.java`, part of a later batch). Concrete `bb2025`/`mixed` structs implement the traits with real, tested logic where the Java body only touches already-ported types (`get_type`/`get_name`, `player_can_not_move` via `PlayerState::is_pinned`/`is_rooted`, `available_actions`, the trivial pass-through `action_context`/`block_action_context` bodies); bodies that call untranslated `LogicModule`/`BlockLogicExtension`/`MoveLogicModule` availability checks (`isChompAvailable`, `isIncorporealAvailable`, `isThenIStartedBlastinAvailable`) or need the acting player's resolved `Player` object (unavailable from the id-only `ActingPlayer` struct) are left as documented-gap no-ops with per-call-site comments, matching the existing `client_communication.rs`/`command_endpoint.rs` gap-documentation convention — no invented logic. Deleted the 10 old PascalCase stub files, added `pub mod plugin;` to `logic/mod.rs`. Tests: 15,713 → 15,734 (+21). |
| Phase ZW.2 Batch D (state/logic root) | 2026-07-11 | 15,974 | 28 | Translated all 28 root-level files in `client/state/logic/` (the plan's ~30 estimate was off by 2; actual directory listing had exactly 28 after excluding the already-done `ClientAction`/`Influences` and the `bb2016/bb2020/bb2025/mixed/interaction/plugin/` subdirs). Anchor: `LogicModule.java` (753 lines) → a slim `pub trait LogicModule` (4 always-abstract methods: `get_id`/`available_actions`/`action_context`/`perform_available_action`; ~15 default lifecycle/interaction methods taking `&FantasyFootballClient`/`&mut FantasyFootballClient` explicitly rather than storing it, matching the `client/handler/*` convention) plus ~60 free `is_xxx_available(game, player)`/`_ap(game, acting_player)` predicate functions factored out for direct unit-testing (48 tests on this file alone). `RangeGridState`/`AbstractBlockLogicModule` (small helpers) and `MoveLogicModule`/`SetupLogicModule`/`BlockLogicExtension` (base/extension classes other concrete modules build on) translated next, then the 22 remaining concrete `*LogicModule` structs (Blitz/DumpOff/HighKick/IllegalSubstitution/Interception/Kickoff/KickoffReturn/Login/PassBlock/PlaceBall/Pushback/QuickSnap/Replay/Setup/SolidDefence/Spectate/StartGame/Swoop/ThrowTeamMate/Touchback/WaitForOpponent/WaitForSetup/Wizard), each a struct implementing `LogicModule` (composition over a held `MoveLogicModule`/`SetupLogicModule` where Java `extends` one of those, direct impl otherwise). Added `jump_mechanic_for`/`ttm_mechanic_for`/`pass_mechanic_for`/`on_the_ball_mechanic_for` dispatch helpers to `ffb-engine::mechanic` (mirroring the existing `game_mechanic_for` precedent) and a `game_mut()` accessor on `FantasyFootballClient` (mirroring `communication_mut()`) — both small, precedented infra additions, not new game logic. **Rust-specific pitfall discovered and documented in-file:** a trait default method taking `&self` silently shadows a same-named inherent `&mut self` method at every call site (method-resolution tries the `&self` step first) — worked around per-file with `Cell<T>` fields or by keeping the inherent method `&self` where only reads were needed. **Documented gaps** (conservative fallbacks, `// java:` comments, no invented logic): `LogicPluginFactory` (still not translated — every `plugin()`/`BaseLogicPlugin`/`MoveLogicPlugin`/`BlockLogicExtensionPlugin` resolution is a no-op/false/empty fallback); `ActingPlayer.getOldPlayerState()`/`hasOnlyStandingUpMove()` and `Player.hasActiveEnhancement()` (no Rust-model fields); `FieldModel` multi-occupancy `getPlayers(coordinate)` (model is 1:1 coordinate→player); `FantasyFootballClient.getProperty()`/`getOverlays()`/`replayInitialized()` (abstract, no in-scope body); `ClientCommunication.send_acting_player` requiring a non-optional `PlayerAction` (no null-action variant); `UtilPassing.findInterceptors` (per-edition-private in `ffb-engine`, not a public API); `PasswordChallenge.createResponse` (MD5 HMAC, no crypto crate dependency); `ffb_protocol::ServerCommand`'s documented not-1:1 simplification (blocks most of `ReplayLogicModule.handle_command`'s cases beyond `SERVER_GAME_STATE`). Tests: 15,734 → 15,974 (+240). |
| Phase ZW.2 Batch D (state/logic editions) | 2026-07-11 | 16,332 | 40 | Translated all 40 edition-specific logic modules under `client/state/logic/{bb2016,bb2020,bb2025,mixed}/` (the plan's ~40 estimate was exact: bb2016 1, bb2020 8, bb2025 13, mixed 18, confirmed via direct directory listing before starting). Parallelized across 5 isolated git worktrees (bb2016+bb2020; bb2025 split into two halves; mixed split into two halves) to avoid concurrent-compile contention in the shared `ffb-client` crate, then merged all worktree diffs back, hand-wrote the shared `bb2025/mod.rs`/`mixed/mod.rs` (each split across two agents, so neither owned the file), and wired `pub mod bb2016;`/`bb2020;`/`bb2025;`/`mixed;` into the parent `client/state/logic/mod.rs`. All 40 concrete structs implement `LogicModule`, composing over `MoveLogicModule`/`BlockLogicExtension`/`AbstractBlockLogicModule`/other Batch-D-root base types (a struct field, not inheritance) wherever the Java class `extends`/mixes one in, delegating to `logic_module`'s free predicate functions where available. Deleted all 40 old PascalCase stub files, corrected all 40 tracker rows to their snake_case Rust paths. **UI stub sites:** exactly the 2 documented in the batch plan (`bb2020::SelectBlitzTargetLogicModule::player_peek`, `bb2025::SelectBlitzTargetLogicModule::player_peek`) — both stubbed to skip only the `getUserInterface().getFieldComponent()...clearMovePath()` rendering side-effect line; no further `getUserInterface()` call sites were found anywhere else in the batch. **New documented gaps beyond the pre-existing list** (conservative fallbacks/local reimplementations, `// java:` comments, no invented logic): `ActingPlayer.isMustCompleteAction()` (no Rust field, conservatively `false`); `UtilPlayer.isFoulable(Game, Player)` (not in `ffb-model`, reimplemented locally in both `bb2025::FoulLogicModule` and `mixed::FoulLogicModule`); `UtilPlayer.canKickTeamMate`/`isKickable` (reimplemented locally in `bb2020::KickTeamMateLikeThrowLogicModule` and `mixed::KickEmBlitz/BlockLogicModule`); `FieldModel.findAdjacentCoordinates(coord, bounds, distance>1, withStart)` general form (no shared public helper beyond `adjacent_on_pitch`'s distance-1 case; reimplemented locally per call site, same pattern as the existing `logic_module.rs` private duplicate); `Game.playingTeamHasActingPLayer()`/`getDefender()`/`getOtherTeam(Team)` (no Rust `Game` equivalents, reimplemented locally in `mixed::ThenIStartedBlastinLogicModule`/`PutridRegurgitationBlitzLogicModule`); `Player.canDeclareSkillAction(property, playerState)` (no per-skill `DeclareCondition` data reachable from a bare `Player`; approximated as `has_unused_skill_with_property(property)` alone, matching the same simplification already made in `block_logic_extension.rs`); `Player.getPosition().getKeywords().contains(LINEMAN)` (`bb2025::SwarmingLogicModule`, no keyword lookup on `Player`, conservatively `false`); `MoveLogicModule`'s protected `actionAvailable` hook has no virtual-dispatch equivalent, so `bb2025::PuntLogicModule`'s acting-player interaction branch reimplements its own `action_available` directly; `mixed::BlockLogicModule` (the `Stab`/`KickEm*`/`MaximumCarnage`/`PutridRegurgitationBlock` superclass) was owned by a different parallel worktree than `bb2020::StabLogicModule`'s, so `Stab`'s unmodified inherited behavior was inlined directly (doc-commented) rather than composed over it; the other 3 sibling files' assumed `BlockLogicModule::new()`/inherent-method API was verified to match after merge (clean compile, no changes needed). Hit the known "`&self` trait default shadows `&mut self` inherent method" pitfall again in both `bb2020`'s and `bb2025`'s `SynchronousMultiBlockLogicModule` (mutable selection-state maps needed from a `player_interaction`-named method); worked around with `RefCell<HashMap<...>>` fields per the documented convention. Tests: 15,974 → 16,332 (+358, avg ~9/file across the 5 parallel batches: 72+41+84+79+90 reported individually, some overlap with shared-helper duplication not double counted in the final total). `cargo test --workspace`: 16,332 passed, 0 failed. |
| Phase ZW.2 Batch D (state root) | 2026-07-11 | 16,412 | 3 | Final batch of `client/state/` — the 3 remaining root files. `ClientState.java` (148 lines, abstract `ClientState<T extends LogicModule, C extends FantasyFootballClient>`) → `client_state.rs`: generic only over `L: LogicModule` (the `C`/`FantasyFootballClient` type param is dropped — one real instantiation in this crate — and the held `fClient` field is likewise dropped, passed explicitly instead, per the `LogicModule`/`client/handler` convention); `enterState`/`leaveState`/`endTurn` (`final` in Java) translated as real inherent methods delegating to the held `logic_module`; `hideSelectSquare`/`showSelectSquare` translate the real coordinate-state transition; `drawSelectSquare` (Java's one always-`abstract` method) has no in-scope concrete body anywhere in this crate (all `ClientStateXxx` Swing subclasses live in `ffb-client`'s AWT layer, out of scope) — left as a documented no-op rather than invented or exposed as an unimplementable trait requirement; AWT `MouseEvent` handlers skipped, the non-`MouseEvent` default bodies (`actionKeyPressed`, drag/drop predicates) translated for real since Java's own bodies are trivial in-scope logic. `ClientStateFactory.java` (368 lines) → `client_state_factory.rs`: `registerStates()`/`registerStatesForRules()` (per-edition `abstract`, no in-scope concrete subclass) reduced to a documented no-op registry shell; the real translation target, `getStateForGame()`/`findPassiveState()` (a pure `Game`-state → `ClientStateId` dispatcher switching on `ClientMode`/`TurnMode`/`ActingPlayer.getPlayerAction()`/pushback squares), is ported branch-by-branch in full, including the `TtmMechanic.handleKickLikeThrow()` real mechanic dispatch (reusing the existing `ttm_mechanic_for` helper) and the `MULTIPLE_BLOCK`→`canBlockTwoAtOnce` skill-property ternary. Two documented gaps: `game.getFinished() != null` has no separate `Date` field on the Rust `Game` model, mapped to `game.status == GameStatus::Finished` instead; `getReplayer().isReplaying()` has no in-scope body (`ClientReplayer` remains a blocked stub) and is conservatively `false`. `IPlayerPopupMenuKeys.java` → `i_player_popup_menu_keys.rs`: 45 `KEY_*` AWT `VK_*` constant aliases, reproduced directly as their standard JDK virtual-key-code values (no AWT dependency in this crate). Corrected `state_dispatch::current_state`'s doc comment (it was already correctly *implemented* as a deliberately coarser TurnMode-only helper, but its old doc comment claimed to "mirror `ClientStateFactory.java`", which was never true and is now fixed) — kept as a separate helper, not merged. Deleted the 3 stale `// client-only: ... superseded by crate::state_dispatch::mod.` comments (never accurate) along with the 3 old PascalCase stub files. Wired all 3 into `client/state/mod.rs`, updated `client/mod.rs`'s stale "not yet wired in" comment. **`client/state/` is now 100% complete**: 85 files total across all 5 batches (4 interaction/value-type + 10 plugin + 28 logic-root + 40 logic-editions + 3 this batch — the original ~85 estimate landed exactly on the nose after all 5 batches' individual reconciliations). Total new tests across the whole `client/state/` effort: 21 + 21 + 240 + 358 + 80 = 720. Tests: 16,332 → 16,412 (+80: 77 in `client_state`/`client_state_factory` incl. one test per `TurnMode` branch and one per `PlayerAction` sub-branch, 3 in `i_player_popup_menu_keys`). `cargo test --workspace`: 16,412 passed, 0 failed. |
| Phase ZW.3 + ZW.4 | 2026-07-11 | 17,305 | 0 | Translated all 211 `client/report/*Message.java` renderers (55 root + 32 bb2016 + 26 bb2020 + 39 bb2025 + 57 mixed) in 5 parallel git-worktree batches, plus the prerequisite `StatusReport`/`TextStyle`/`ParagraphStyle`/`ReportMessageBase`/`ReportMessageType` (un-skipping the two style enums, miscategorized as Swing in ZW.0). See Progress Summary above for full detail. Tests: 16,412 → 17,305 (+893). `cargo test --workspace`: 17,305 passed, 0 failed. **This completes Phase ZW: all 373 in-scope `ffb-client-logic` files are genuinely translated.** Docs closeout (this row + Progress Summary + `docs/PHASE_ZW_PLAN.md` final numbers) done same session. |
| ZW.1 (partial) | 2026-07-10 | 14,904 | 29 | Closed out 6 of the 35 remaining `~` `ffb-server/net` stub files: `CommandServlet`/`FileServlet` (Jetty servlet → axum route/handler, wired into `FantasyFootballServer::run()`'s router), `ServerDbKeepAliveTask`/`ServerGameTimeTask`/`ServerNetworkEntropyTask`/`SessionTimeoutTask` (`TimerTask` → `tokio::time::interval` loops, spawned from `run()`, gated by new `FFB_TIMER_*`/`FFB_SESSION_TIMEOUT_*` env vars mirroring the Java `IServerProperty` gates). **Discovered these 6 files (plus their existing stub tests) were never wired into `net/mod.rs` — dead code not compiled or counted** — fixed as part of this closeout. Along the way: added `Fortuna` to `FantasyFootballServer` (`getFortuna()`), gave `DbConnectionManager` a `Clone` impl (async tasks pull an owned copy out from behind `std::sync::Mutex` before `.await`, avoiding non-`Send` futures), and added the previously-missing `ServerCommunication.sendToReplaySession`/`close`/`sendGameTime` equivalents (`ServerCommunication` now owns a shared `ReplaySessionManager`, given `register_sender`/`send_to` so replay broadcasts have somewhere to write — `ServerCommunication.java` was already tracked `✓` before this, so its row is unchanged). Tests: 14,794 → 14,904 (+110). Remaining: 29 `~` files. |
